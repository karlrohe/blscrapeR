This is a fork of [blscrapeR](https://github.com/keberwein/blscrapeR).  The only edit made was to return "all the data downloaded" from `get_bls_county()`. The old default was to subset this by date and region.  I wanted to keep all the data.  All other files were deleted and `get_bls_county()` was moved into the top of the directory.  This was forked Jan 30, 2020.
